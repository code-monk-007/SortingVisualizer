# SortingVisualizer
###### Welcome to Sorting Visualizer! I built this web-application because I was fascinated by sorting algorithms, and I wanted to visualize them in action. I hope that you enjoy playing around with this visualization tool just as much as I enjoyed building it.
You can directly access it at https://code-monk-007.github.io/SortingVisualizer/.
